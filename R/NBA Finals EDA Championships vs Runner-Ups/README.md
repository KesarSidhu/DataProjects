# NBA Finals EDA: Championships vs Runner-Ups

### Task
Aim to study the changing play styles of NBA Championship teams and explore how home-court advantage affects team performances. 
To understand the broader scope of the project, we'll address specific questions:

* In which areas did NBA Championship teams consistently outperform the runner-ups in NBA Finals games?
* Which teams achieved the most success, and which fell short the most? How do their performances compare?
* What impact does home-court advantage have on NBA Finals performance?
* How has the play style of championship-winning teams evolved over timeâ€”are they more offense-centered or defensive-minded?
