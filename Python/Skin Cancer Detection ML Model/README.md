# ðŸ¦  Skin Cancer Detection ML Model

### Task
Developed a machine learning model designed to predict skin cancer from clinical images of skin lesions. This tool was created with intention of helping people detect cancer earlier and more conveniently since a difference of a few days could save a life. This model was trained on more than 1800 images and can identify 6 types of cancerous skin lesions:
- Actinic Keratosis (ACK)
- Basal Cell Carsinoma (BCC)
- Malignant Melanoma (MEL)
- Melanocytic Nevus of Skin (NEV)
- Squamoud Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
- Serborrheic Keratosis (SEK)

  



Developed a skin cancer detection model in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn with ResNet50, capable of identifying 6 types of cancerous skin lesions
