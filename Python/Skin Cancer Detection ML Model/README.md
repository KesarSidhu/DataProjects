# ðŸ¦  Skin Cancer Detection ML Model

### Task
Developed a machine learning model to predict skin cancer from clinical images of skin lesions. This tool aims to help people detect cancer earlier and more conveniently, as even a few days can make a life-saving difference. The model was trained on over 1,800 images and can identify six types of cancerous skin lesions:
- Actinic Keratosis (ACK)
- Basal Cell Carsinoma (BCC)
- Malignant Melanoma (MEL)
- Melanocytic Nevus of Skin (NEV)
- Squamoud Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
- Serborrheic Keratosis (SEK)

### Data Source
- Date used to train and test the model is gathered by the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479321/)

### Tools
- Google CoLab
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow (ResNet50 model), Scikit-Learn
- Figma
- Streamlit
